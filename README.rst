Getting Started
###############

Developpement environnement
---------------------------

Surveil's developpement environnement is based on Docker and docker-compose.

You can install docker-compose with the following command:

    :bash:`sudo pip install -U docker-compose`

You will then be able to use the environment with the following commands:

* :bash:`sudo docker-compose up`: Launch Surveil and its dependencies in containers.
* :bash:`sudo docker-compose down`: Kill the active docker containers, if any.
* :bash:`sudo docker-compose rm`: Remove all containers, if any.
* :bash:`sudo docker-compose`: Build the docker images.

Configuration for the different services running in the Docker containers are
stored in tools/docker.

After running :bash:`sudo docker-compose up`, you should be able to acces all
services at the ports configured in the docker-compose.yml file.

* Surveil API: http://localhost:8080/v1/hello
* InfluxDB: http://localhost:8083 (user:root pw:root)
* Grafana: http://localhost:80 (user:admin pw:admin)
* Shinken WebUI: http://localhost:7767/all (user:admin pw:admin)

The Surveil container mounts your local project folder and pecan reloads every
time the project files change thus providing a proper development environment.
